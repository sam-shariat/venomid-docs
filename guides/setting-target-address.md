# Setting Target Address

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set a target wallet address.

## Why setting the target wallet address?

Target wallet address ensures that if someone wants to transfer tokens using your Venom domain, the tokens will be automatically transferred to your Venom wallet.

### There are two ways to set a target wallet address.

## 1-While Domain Registration

"If you intend to do this during domain registration, in the final step, after confirming the transaction within your Venom wallet to register the domain, in the window depicted in the image below, you can specify your target wallet address."

For this, you can select your default Venom wallet address by choosing the button indicated in the image above. Otherwise, you can also copy the addresses of other Venom wallets into the specified field and then click on “Set Target Address.” Then click “Confirm” button.

## 2- while customizing your domain

after you have registered your domain and want to customize it, you can set a target wallet address too.

To do this, first go to Venom ID website. Once you have connected your wallet to the website as shown in the image below, go to the "my names" section.
